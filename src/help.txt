1.1 Board

The game is played on an n*m board.

1.2 Players

Unlike tiles and bubbles, players aren't restricted to certain positions on the board. 

Each player is controlled either by a human player or by an AI.

1.3 Tiles

Each tile on the board can be empty, have a tree, or have a cactus.

Trees and cacti are obstacles.

Empty tiles can have boxes placed on them. No two boxes share the same tile. Boxes can block player movements but can be destroyed.

1.4 Bubbles

Bubbles can be placed by players or released from destroyed boxes. In specific game modes, bubbles may appear or disappear according to the rules.

When bubbles explode, certain tiles are affected. The explosion effect will last for 500 milliseconds, while the damage effect is instant.
