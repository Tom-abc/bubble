1.1 Board

The game is played on an n*m board.

1.2 Players

Unlike tiles and bubbles, players aren't restricted to certain positions on the board. 

Each player is controlled either by a human player or by an AI.

The list below shows the basic movement speed and immune time of each character.

BOY: 120px/s 1s
GIRL: 90px/s 1.5s
BLUE BOY: 140px/s 0.7s
BLUE GIRL: 105px/s 1.2s

1.3 Tiles

Each tile on the board can be empty, have a tree, or have a cactus.

Trees and cacti are obstacles.

Empty tiles can have boxes placed on them. No two boxes share the same tile. Boxes can block player movements but can be destroyed.

1.4 Bubbles

Bubbles can be placed by players or released from destroyed boxes.

When bubbles explode, certain tiles are affected. The explosion effect will last for 500 milliseconds, while the damage effect is instant.

1.5 Potions

Speed potion can bring you 1.5x movement speed for 10 seconds. Attack potion can make the bubbles you place within the next 10 seconds more powerful.

Potions may appear above boxes. If so, you need to destroy the box before you can reach the potion.

2 Game Modes

2.1 PVP Mode

Player 1 uses WASD to move. Player 2 uses arrows. Player 1 uses Q to place blue bubbles and E to place red bubbles. Player 2 uses N to place blue bubbles and M to place red bubbles.

Player 1 uses A and D to switch when choosing character. Player 2 uses left and right arrow keys.

2.2 Box Mode

First, you'll enter a scene where you can use A and D to switch your character. When ready, you can click the ready button.

The goal is to get as many points as possible by destroying boxes. You'll get 2 points upon destroying a gold box and 1 point upon destroying other types of box.

If you are affected by a bubble, you'll lose points according to the damage you take.
